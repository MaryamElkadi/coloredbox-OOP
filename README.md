# coloredbox-OOP

This project involves the implementation of a ColoredBox class in C++. The class represents a dynamic 2D array of characters that forms a box structure. The box's attributes include the character used to build the box, its dimensions (length and width), and the color of the box (represented as an integer). The class also tracks the largest area among all created box objects using a static member variable.
